Introduction
------------

If you have a [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io) file in your repository,
you can use this action to automatically convert it into a [Citation File Format
(cff)](https://citation-file-format.github.io) file. Add the
following to your workflow

```
      - name: Convert to CFF
        uses: caltechlibrary/codemeta2cff@main
```

A full workflow for converting on a release is available at https://github.com/caltechlibrary/codemeta2cff/blob/main/.github/workflows/codemeta2cff.yml


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

Only a limited subset of CodeMeta and CFF fields have been mapped. You can
contribute by improving the codemeta2cff application at https://github.com/caltechlibrary/datatools

Getting help
